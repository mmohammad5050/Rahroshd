			<p>Web development means building and maintaining websites that are created for the internet or intranet. Web developers work with clients to better understand the requirements of the website and then build and test it. Web development involves coding and programming that gives functionality to the website.

				Web development can be divided into three parts: frontend development, backend development and database technology. Frontend development refers to everything that is shown in the web application or the final result that is displayed on the user's device. Frontend development is done using languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Backend development refers to everything that happens behind the scenes or the logic and functionality behind the website. Backend development is done using languages such as PHP, Python, Ruby and Java. Database technology refers to how data related to the website is stored, retrieved and processed. Database technology is done using systems such as MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle and SQL Server. <br>
