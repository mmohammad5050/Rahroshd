			<p>Game design is a creative and technical process in which one or more game designers specify the idea, rules, content, story, characters, graphics, sound, music and gameplay of a game. Game design can be done for different types of games, such as board games, video games, online games, sports games, role-playing games and so on. Game design is a multidisciplinary profession that requires artistic, technical, literary and psychological skills. Game design usually involves the following steps:

				- Ideation: In this step, the game designer has a preliminary idea for their game and expresses it in a brief and general way. The game idea can be inspired by various sources, such as stories, movies, books, other games, personal experiences, social issues and so on. The game idea should be attractive, unique, feasible and suitable for the target group.
				- Project goal setting: In this step, the game designer determines their objectives from making the game. The objectives can include things such as entertainment, education, criticism, expression of creativity, creating solidarity, improving skills and so on. Project goal setting helps the game designer to design their game according to the needs and interests of the target group.
				- Team formation: In this step, the game designer selects skilled and committed people to collaborate in making the game. The game design team can include different roles, such as programmer, graphic designer, sound engineer, writer, game tester and so on. Team formation helps the game designer to deliver their game with high quality and on time.
				- Document design: In this step, the game designer prepares the documents related to their game. The game design documents include things such as game design document (GDD), paper prototypes, diagrams, tables, maps, scripts, artistic concepts and so on. The game design documents help the game designer to describe their game in detail and accurately and communicate with other team members.
				- Implementation: In this step, the game designer implements their game using the appropriate tools and technologies. Implementation includes things such as programming, graphic design, sound and music production, content creation, integration of elements and so on. Implementation helps the game designer to produce their game in a practical and executable way.
				- Testing: In this step, the game designer tests their game to find and fix bugs, defects, errors and potential problems. Testing can be done internally (by team members) or externally (by target players). Testing helps the game designer to improve their game and increase its quality.
				- Publication: In this step, the game designer publishes their game for the public. Publication can be physical (in the form of disk, card, book and so on) or digital (in the form of file, application, website and so on). Publication helps the game designer to reach their desired players and generate income. <br>
